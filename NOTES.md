# DISCOVERIES
*    Phaser has no order problem with Object Layers in tilemaps. Phaser uses the same tile in the tileset for tiles in an object layer.
*    You cannot move Tilemaps around; you have to define your HUD on the tilemap layer.





# TODO
*    Refactor entities into prefabs.
*    Create states for prefabs.
*    Figure out how to add properties to tiles in an object layer.
